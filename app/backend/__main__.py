from __future__ import absolute_import, print_function

# __future__ serves 3 purposes:
# Avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and to find the modules they’re importing.
# Ensure future statements run under releases prior to 2.1 at least yield runtime exceptions.
# Document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they will be — or were — made mandatory.
